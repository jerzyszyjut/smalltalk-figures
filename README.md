# smalltalk-figures
Simple project in Smalltalk language made to understand basic concepts and syntax.
Easiest way to run this code is using [jdoodle online compiler](https://www.jdoodle.com/execute-smalltalk-online/). For local development I used Squeak IDE. Compiler used to develop project is GNU Smalltalk 3.2.92.
